All other degrees of freedom are fixed. The dipole moment is projected along the \ce {O-H} stretch unit vector. The second order polynomial fit allows us to read off the corresponding dipole derivatives needed in the evaluation of the field-dependent morse potential. \relax }}{2}{}\protected@file@percent }
